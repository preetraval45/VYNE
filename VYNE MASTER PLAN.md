## Post-launch QA fixes (Jun 5, 2026 full-user testing report) ⏳

Findings from a paying-user walkthrough of prod. The report praised Chat, Video Call + AI Meeting Recap, Calendar "Find a Time", the custom-widget Dashboard, and Sales/Quotations. The items below are the gaps — fix order is P0 crashes → P1 AI core → P2 silent failures → UX polish → enhancements. File pointers marked _(confirm)_ are best-guess starting points, not yet root-caused.

### P0 — Blockers (white-screen crashes, reproducible)

- [x] **BUG #1 — Global search crashes the whole app on every keystroke** — ROOT CAUSE: [GlobalSearchModal.tsx](apps/web/src/components/layout/GlobalSearchModal.tsx) subscribed to the whole `useSearchAnalytics` store, then a keystroke effect called `record()` (which mutates that store) with the store object in its deps → infinite render loop → React #185 → white screen. Fix: read analytics via `getState()` (non-subscribing), like CommandPalette does. Verified typecheck-clean. _(Bonus: replaced the magnifier-icon-opens-popup with an inline [GlobalSearchInput](apps/web/src/components/layout/GlobalSearchInput.tsx) bar in the topbar — live results dropdown + gear → advanced modal.)_
- [x] **BUG #2 — "+ New Issue" crashes after creation** — ROOT CAUSE: `addTask` in [projects.ts](apps/web/src/lib/stores/projects.ts) only defaulted `activity`/`attachments`; `QuickCreateIssueModal` passes only `{title, status, priority}`, so `tags`/`comments`/`subtasks` were `undefined` and the board card's `task.tags.slice(...)` threw `reading 'slice'`. Fix: `addTask` now backfills every required field (defense-in-depth for any partial caller) + render-site guards (`task.tags ?? []`, etc.) in [projects/[projectId]/page.tsx](<apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/projects/[projectId]/page.tsx>) so already-persisted bad rows also survive. Verified typecheck-clean.

### P1 — AI core non-functional (this is the product's identity)

- [x] **BUG #3 — Vyne AI doesn't respond to chat queries** — ROOT CAUSE: [/api/ai/stream](apps/web/src/app/api/ai/stream/route.ts) always attached Gemini's NATIVE `google_search` grounding tool, but the request goes to Gemini's OpenAI-COMPAT endpoint (`/v1beta/openai/…`), which rejects that shape with a 400 and sinks the whole answer. Fix: grounding is now opt-in via `GEMINI_ENABLE_GROUNDING` (off by default) + a retry-without-grounding net on any 4xx, so an optional capability can't kill the core response; plus clearer surfaced errors for 429 (quota) and 401/403 (bad/missing key) instead of silent failure. Verified typecheck-clean. **Still needs a valid `GEMINI_API_KEY` in Vercel env** to actually answer.
- [x] **BUG #4 — AI auto-fill does nothing** — ROOT CAUSE: [AiFormFill](apps/web/src/components/shared/AiFormFill.tsx) posted the description as `context.userText` to [/api/ai/ask](apps/web/src/app/api/ai/ask/route.ts), but that route's `serializeContext` drops unknown context keys (the model never saw the text) AND it supports only `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`GROQ_API_KEY`, not the app's `GEMINI_API_KEY` → fell to a prose `localFallback` with no JSON. Fix: new purpose-built [/api/ai/extract](apps/web/src/app/api/ai/extract/route.ts) endpoint (Gemini→Groq→Claude with JSON mode + a regex local fallback for email/phone/url) and repointed AiFormFill at it with real error surfacing (shows the "no values found" / "needs API key" note instead of silently doing nothing). The "Filling…" spinner already existed, so UX item #7 is covered too. Verified typecheck-clean. **Needs `GEMINI_API_KEY` in Vercel env for full free-text extraction; demo mode still fills email/phone/url via regex.**
- [x] **BUG #5 — AI Daily Brief never loads** — ROOT CAUSE: response-shape mismatch, not a key issue. The home card ([DailyDigestCard.tsx](apps/web/src/components/home/DailyDigestCard.tsx)) calls [/api/ai/digest](apps/web/src/app/api/ai/digest/route.ts), which returns `{ digest: {...}, provider, generatedAt }` (digest NESTED), but the card did `setData(json)` expecting `{headline, summary, bullets}` at top level → `data.headline` was always undefined so the headline fell through to "Click refresh to brief me on today" even on a successful 200. Compounded by a silent `if (!res.ok) return;`. Fix: unwrap `json.digest` (accept both shapes), surface real errors (429/HTTP/empty/network) in the card headline instead of silently reverting. The route already returns a valid FALLBACK digest, so it works even without an AI key. Verified typecheck-clean. **All five report bugs (P0 #1-2, P1 #3-5) now fixed.**

### P2 — Correctness / silent failures

- [x] **Character-encoding mojibake** — was a double-encoded middot (`·` U+00B7 saved as Latin-1 → `Â·`) NOT just on accounts/contacts but across **9 dashboard pages** (contacts, crm, finance, invoicing, hr, sales, ops, field-service, expenses). Fixed every occurrence to a proper UTF-8 `·`; verified zero `Â` left in `src/**`.
- [x] **Sales view resets to a filtered state after product creation** — the opportunities filter is local state (so it resets on remount), but there was no escape if a filter WAS active. Added a visible **"✕ Clear · showing X of Y"** control to the [Opportunities toolbar](<apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/sales/page.tsx>) (resets search + stage), and changed the [New Product form](<apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/sales/products/new/page.tsx>) to redirect to `/sales?view=products` (the list you just added to) instead of the default Opportunities tab.
- [x] **Opportunity form: no validation feedback** — the Create button was disabled when invalid, so clicking did nothing. Now the button is always enabled; submit runs inline validation, shows per-field error text + red border on the missing required field (name/company), and focuses + smooth-scrolls to the first invalid field. [opportunities/new](<apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/sales/opportunities/new/page.tsx>).

### UX polish

- [x] **Sidebar collapses on accidental click with no easy re-expand** — collapse was already deliberate (only the `PanelLeftClose` button), but when collapsed the only way back was the bare logo. Added a dedicated, always-visible expand button (`PanelLeftOpen`, bordered) under the logo in [Sidebar.tsx](apps/web/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx).
- [x] **AI chat history entries are indistinguishable** — [ConversationHistory.tsx](apps/web/src/components/ai/ConversationHistory.tsx) used the LAST message (often a shared error) as the preview. Now shows the first user message + a message count as preview, and the timestamp includes the time so two same-day "generate a dog image" sessions are tellable apart.
- [x] **AI auto-fill needs a loading state** — [AiFormFill](apps/web/src/components/shared/AiFormFill.tsx) already flips the button to "Filling…"; added an explicit accent "Parsing your input…" status line while busy.
- [x] **Read receipt "Seen · N" needs a tooltip** — added `seenNames()` to the [readReceipts store](apps/web/src/lib/stores/readReceipts.ts); [MessageRow](apps/web/src/components/chat/MessageRow.tsx) now hovers "Seen by Sarah K., Tony M.…" (read imperatively via `getState()` to avoid the React #185 fresh-array-selector trap).
- [x] **Sales → Reports tab is empty** — already populated in the current code (KPI cards, win/loss insights, monthly-revenue bar chart, top-deals tables); the Jun 5 "empty" note predates that content. No change needed.

### Enhancements (suggestions)

- [x] **Cmd+K / Ctrl+K to open global search** — already bound (CommandPalette). Added a discoverable `⌘K`/`Ctrl K` badge to the inline [GlobalSearchInput](apps/web/src/components/layout/GlobalSearchInput.tsx) that opens the palette on click.
- [x] **Screen-share gives no feedback** — already correct in code: [call store](apps/web/src/lib/stores/call.ts) `toggleScreenShare` calls the real `getDisplayMedia` and sets `error` on failure; [GlobalCallPanel](apps/web/src/components/layout/GlobalCallPanel.tsx) surfaces it via an `ErrorToast`. No change needed (the report's "no prompt" was likely a denied/blocked permission, which now shows the toast).
- [x] **"Find a Time" should show day context** — [ScheduleMeetingModal](apps/web/src/components/calendar/ScheduleMeetingModal.tsx) slot chips now read "Today/Tomorrow/Mon, 08:00" instead of a bare time.
- [x] **Home app-launcher grid customisation** — added a "Customize" toggle on the [home](<apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/home/page.tsx>) app grid; in edit mode each tile shows a hide (×) / restore (+) badge, hidden tiles are dropped from the normal view and the count shows as "Apps · N hidden". Persisted to localStorage.
- [x] **AI first-run onboarding prompt** — new `AiRolePrompt` on an empty [AI chat](<apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/ai/chat/page.tsx>) asks "What's your role?" with quick options; the pick is saved as a persistent memory fact (`addFact`) so the stream endpoint calibrates answers. Self-dismisses once a role fact exists; "Skip" available.

## UI Review — Rating & Improvement Suggestions (Jun 8, 2026)

A walkthrough of the Home, Dashboard, AI Chat, and navigation areas.

### Overall Rating: **7.5 / 10**

Strong, polished dark-mode aesthetic and a clear product identity — modern and professional for a B2B OS tool. Several friction points hold it back from being truly great, mostly around **discoverability** and **onboarding clarity**.

### What's Working Well ✅

- **Visual Design (9/10)** — dark navy scheme, rounded cards, colored emoji-style module icons, green accent → cohesive, premium feel. Clean, legible typography.
- **Information Hierarchy on Home** — alerts (stock warning, plan usage, daily activity) prioritized at top in a clear card stack. Critical info first.
- **Left Sidebar Navigation** — collapsible tree with icons is intuitive; active-item highlight (teal/green left border + text color) clearly shows location.
- **AI Integration** — "Vyne AI" sits in both the top bar and the sidebar, making AI a first-class citizen rather than a bolt-on.
- **Module Grid on Home** — colorful, distinguishable icon grid works as a visual launchpad.

### Issues & What Can Be Improved ⚠️

- [ ] **1. Redundant Navigation (biggest UX issue)** — left sidebar and home module grid show the same destinations, creating cognitive duplication. Repurpose the home grid to show personalized/recent modules only, or remove it.
- [ ] **2. Sidebar cut off at the bottom** — on the default viewport the sidebar cuts off (Finance is last visible; HR/CRM missing) with no indicator there's more below. Add a fade-out gradient or scroll indicator.
- [ ] **3. Unclear iconography in the top bar** — top-right icons (chat, bell, search, document, "Get app") have no labels; tooltips exist but labels or persistent tooltips would be more accessible.
- [ ] **4. "Vyne AI Daily Digest" card is passive** — says "Click refresh to brief me on today" but the whole card is clickable with no obvious button. Add a visible "Generate Brief" CTA inside the card. _(Ties to BUG #5.)_
- [ ] **5. "Get Started" checklist is buried** — onboarding checklist (0%) sits below the fold under the grid; new users need it most. Make it collapsible and pin it near the top, or surface via a welcome modal.
- [ ] **6. Dashboard widget labels are very small** — all-caps tiny titles ("MRR — TOTAL", "OPEN ORDERS") are hard to scan. Use slightly larger, sentence-case labels.
- [ ] **7. "+ New Issue" button uses jargon** — for an all-in-one OS tool, "Issue" is confusing. Rename to "+ New Task" or make it context-aware per module.
- [ ] **8. No visual section grouping in the module grid** — 24 modules in a flat 6-column grid with no categories. Add subtle section headers (e.g. "People", "Operations", "Finance") for scannability.
- [ ] **9. Bottom status bar is ambiguous** — user avatar + "Set status" and four tiny unlabeled icons (settings, theme, presence, logout). Enlarge/label them; give "Set status" more prominence for a team-collaboration tool.

### Quick Win Priority List

| Priority  | Fix                                                      |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔴 High   | Add visual scroll indicator / fade to sidebar            |
| 🔴 High   | Add visible CTA button inside the AI Daily Digest card   |
| 🟡 Medium | Group the module grid into labeled categories            |
| 🟡 Medium | Surface the "Get Started" checklist higher for new users |
| 🟡 Medium | Rename "+ New Issue" to something more intuitive         |
| 🟢 Low    | Add labels or persistent tooltips to top-bar icons       |
| 🟢 Low    | Increase label font size on Dashboard widgets            |

## Shipped this session (Jun 8, 2026) ✅

All items below are typecheck-verified (`tsc --noEmit`, exit 0). Committed as `6795c72` + pushed to GitHub `main`; deployed to Vercel prod.

### P0 crash fixes

- [x] **BUG #1 — global search white-screen** — see the root-cause note under P0 above. Fixed in [GlobalSearchModal.tsx](apps/web/src/components/layout/GlobalSearchModal.tsx) (read analytics via `getState()`, not a store subscription). Lesson recorded in the `zustand-selector-stability` memory.
- [x] **BUG #2 — "+ New Issue" crash** — see the root-cause note under P0 above. Fixed in [projects.ts](apps/web/src/lib/stores/projects.ts) `addTask` (backfills all required fields) + render guards in [projects/[projectId]/page.tsx](<apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/projects/[projectId]/page.tsx>).

### P1 AI core

- [x] **BUG #3 — Vyne AI doesn't respond** — see the root-cause note under P1 above. Fixed in [/api/ai/stream](apps/web/src/app/api/ai/stream/route.ts): grounding gated behind `GEMINI_ENABLE_GROUNDING` + retry-without-grounding on 4xx + clearer 429/401-403 messages. **Needs a valid `GEMINI_API_KEY` in Vercel env to actually answer.** BUG #4 (auto-fill) and BUG #5 (daily brief) still pending.

### Global search — inline navbar bar (replaces the popup)

- [x] **New [GlobalSearchInput](apps/web/src/components/layout/GlobalSearchInput.tsx) in the topbar** — always-visible "Search records…" bar with a live grouped results dropdown as you type (keyboard nav, click-to-navigate), plus a gear that opens the advanced filter modal. Replaced the old magnifier-icon-opens-popup (`SearchTopbarButton` removed from [UnifiedTopBar.tsx](apps/web/src/components/layout/UnifiedTopBar.tsx)). Reuses the existing corpus/scoring and reads analytics via `getState()` so it can't reintroduce BUG #1. The advanced modal (`GlobalSearchModal`, Ctrl+/) is retained behind the gear. Per-page **filter** search bars are untouched — global search and per-page filter are now two distinct bars, as requested.

### Vendors — dedicated page + sidebar link + richer form

- [x] **Standalone [/vendors](<apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/vendors/page.tsx>) page** — searchable, sortable vendor list (name, contact, category, terms, outstanding, status), row-click detail drawer showing all fields, delete with confirm, empty state. Previously vendors were only reachable as a tab buried under Invoicing.
- [x] **Sidebar "Vendors" link** now points to `/vendors` (was `/invoicing?view=vendors`) in [Sidebar.tsx](apps/web/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx). The Invoicing → Vendors tab still works at `/invoicing?view=vendors`.
- [x] **Enriched `Vendor` model + add form** — added optional `website`, `category`, `paymentTerms`, `taxId`, `address`, `notes` to the [invoicing store](apps/web/src/lib/stores/invoicing.ts) `Vendor` type + `addVendor`; the [New Vendor form](<apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/invoicing/vendors/new/page.tsx>) now captures them (was just name/contact/email/phone) and supports a `?return=` param so it routes back to `/vendors`.
